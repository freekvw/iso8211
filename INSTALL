Installing the iso8211 package
==============================

This document last edited April 3, 2004, Derek Chen-Becker.

This document assumes you are working under Unix. This package has not been
tested under any other operating systems (in fact, it has not been tested for
portability much at all). Please bear in mind that this is NOT production
software, nor is it in any sense "finished"! This package has been tested
on Linux with Python 2.2, but we welcome reports of succesful usage on other
OSes/Python versions.


1) This file (INSTALL) should be in a directory called "iso8211". This
   directory, as a whole, constitures a Python package.

2) I assume that you already have Python installed - if not, you will need to
   get it at: 

		http://www.python.org/


3) Place the "iso8211" directory somewhere that is on the Python path. This
   can be done by either putting it into a location that is already on the
   path, or by adding its location to the path.

   There should be a python library directory on your computer, such as

        /usr/lib/python2.2

   If you place the "iso8211" directory there it will be available to all
   users on your machine. If you do not want this or do not have access
   to this directory, use the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

   For instance, if the environment variable PYTHONPATH is set to:

	/usr/users/tony/lib/python

   then this package would be available if the directory were placed in that
   directory. Alternatively, if this directory were placed in (for instance)
   /usr/local/python (thus becoming /usr/local/python/iso8211), then it would
   be appropriate to change PYTHONPATH to be:

	/usr/users/tony/lib/python:/usr/local/python

4) To make the "iso8211" command available, either add this directory to your
   PATH, or make an appropriate link to the iso8211 file within this directory
   such that the link is `visible' as a command on the path.

Specific advice for Laser-Scan
==============================

I recommend doing the following:

	1) Create a directory such as /tools/share/lsl/python
	2) Place this directory therein
	3) Tell people that if they want to use this software, then they should
	   add the following to their .cshrc (or whatever):

		alias  iso8211		/tools/share/lsl/python/iso8211/iso8211
		setenv PYTHONPATH	${PYTHONPATH}:/tools/share/lsl/python

	   (as well as whatever they need to use Python itself, of course! -
	    and this omits to test if the PYTHONPATH variable already existed
	    or not...)
