This package provides support for (initially, just reading) ISO 8211 files

http://sourceforge.net/projects/py-iso8211/

Initial code: TJ Ibbs, 17 Feb 1994
Updated: Apr 3, 2004, Derek Chen-Becker

The structure of a DDF (as held here) is:

	DDF
	 |
	[1] --- DDR (nb: sub-class of Record)
	 |	\
	 |	{ "tag" :: Field_desc }
	 |		   \
	 |		    field_controls, data_field_name,
	 |		    array_descriptor, format_controls
	 |
	[*] --- Record
	 	\
		[1] --- Leader
		 |
		[1] --- Directory
		 |	 |
		 |	[*] --- Field
		 |		\
		 |		 tag, length, data
		 |
		[1] --- Field_area


See module variables "Changes" and "Version" for the obvious things...
